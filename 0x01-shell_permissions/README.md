# 0x01. Shell, permissions

This is the ALX Software engineering program. I will be sharing my progress and what I learn.

In this particular lesson/project I wen't through shell permissions.

This project's purpose is to help familiarize us with the shell terminal on Linux. Specifically, these are scripts that deal with permissions on the Linux command line.

Each particular file has a corresponding command in it.

Enjoy Coding ❤
